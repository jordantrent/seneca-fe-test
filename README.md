# Seneca Front End Task

## Notes

- The component is designed to accept a dynamic number of options per slider, and sliders per question. You can even have questions that have a mix of sliders which have a different amount of options.
- The only requirement of note is that the correct answer must be declared in the same order as the options are declared, There's a note in the code where this applies.
